        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on creating a full-stack web application designed to help university students find compatible roommates based on personal preferences and lifestyle habits.

.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>User authentication and profile creation</li>
            <li>Preference-based matching algorithm e.g., gender, noise tolerance, room sharing, etc.</li>
            <li>Real-time match cards with compatibility scores</li>
            <li>Accept/reject match system with mutual confirmation notifications</li>
            <li>Profile image upload and editable preferences dashboard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>Syncing data between React components and the Node/Express backend (especially for live updates like accept/reject flow) required careful state management and API design</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>RoommateMatch was a valuable project that deepened my understanding of full-stack development, especially in handling real-world user interaction flows and data-driven matching logic. It challenged me to think critically about user experience, security, and system design. This project not only strengthened my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB but also taught me how to build scalable and user-focused web applications.</p>
